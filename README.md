## Work in progress
Currently there are only UEF and Cybran units (the latter two buttons).

## What does this thing do?
Ever wanted to know how much it would cost to build 7 T2 Pillar tanks, 13 T1 UEF submarines, and 27 T1 Mantis bots? Well now you know. This little app sums up mass cost and energy cost of selected units and buildings.

Still, it is a WIP project, hence I took the values from the wiki. I still need to clarify the current values in the FAF in case of changes in mass or energy costs.
